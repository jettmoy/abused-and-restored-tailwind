              Jann's Story
            </h1>
            <p>
              This girlâ€™s story initially opened my eyes to the cruelty of child
              sexual exploitation and abuse.

              After meeting a young girl in Northern Thailand many years ago, my
              heart was forever committed to helping young women and children
              caught in the trap of human trafficking and exploitation. Nom Ying
              is only one of thousands who have been exploited.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Here is her story: Nom Ying was only 8 years of age when she met
              Western men that visited her small, remote rice village in
              Northern Thailand, a simple, poor community. That year the rice
              crop failed; her parents and community lost everything. She told
              me how these Western men who came to live in the village were so
              kind and offered to help with the default in the rice crop. Her
              parents as well as many in the village accepted their offer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It was at night when Nom Ying heard a knock on the door; the men
              came to collect the money they lent to her parents. Lacking the
              money, until the final crop came in, the men gave them a little
              more time. Again they came back at night; her parents still didn't
              have enough money. The men offered to take Nom Ying, educate her
              and get her a well-paying job so that her parents owed nothing.
              Nom Ying was awakened, and sent with the men, whom she learned to
              trust since they lived in the village and helped everyone. She was
              put in a large van while they picked up other girls in the
              village.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As soon as they were out of the village, all the girls were
              blindfolded and their mouths were taped. This shocked the girls;
              they thought that these men were their friends. Nom Ying told me
              how they drove all night and into the next day and then that
              night.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The dirty van finally stopped, and Nom Ying was put by herself
              into her torture chamber. It was a small cubical that was no
              bigger than her outstretched body. It had no windows, a small door
              and a cement floor. She was given rice and water once a day, and
              held captive for over 11 days. Remember, she was only 8 and may
              not have been able to count any higher. When she was removed from
              her cubical, her eyes had to adjust to the light. Weak and
              disoriented, she followed her captors.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is where her true nightmare began: She was brought into a
              room with a large bed and she was tied on the bed. The men began
              sexually defiling her with objects such as broom handles and beer
              bottles. The torture was beyond her comprehension!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As she was telling me the story, Nom Ying said she didn't
              understand why her parents would give her away to these men so
              they could torment, afflict, and torture her, so brutally. She had
              always been such a good and obedient daughter.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Nom Ying's tragic career as an exploited sex worker began at the
              age of 8. She was trafficked to more than 5 countries when she was
              finally tossed out at age 19 because she was too old. Rescued by
              an aid worker in Malaysia, she found her way back to her small
              village, only to discover that her father had died, and her mother
              disowned her, not believing a word of what Nom Ying told her about
              her nightmare life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              That's when I decided that I would be committed to helping
              children and young women like Nom Ying, so that they never have to
              face what she did.
