              Abandoned Abused & Restored is committed to helping women,
              children, boys and girls, who are in danger of being sexually
              exploited, abandoned by loved ones, and abused by predators. We
              provide restoration for those that are marginalized, impoverished,
              devalued, disgraced, and disillusioned. We address the severity of
              global sexual exploitation and trafficking through education,
              prevention, and intervention, focusing on restoration of body,
              soul, and spirit.
